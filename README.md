space squad-y multiplayer RPG!

## Getting Started

* Activate a venv and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start server by navigating to backend and run with `make`
* Start frontend by navigating to frontend and running wth `make m`

Tweak your IDE/vs code run configurations to mirror that behavior :D

## Development

* Install protobuf compiler and ensure it is on PATH
* From proto directory, make changes and use `make deploy` to cp to other projects

## TODO

v1:

* Shooting!
* Login + character persistence

v2:
* Zoom screen out
* friend/foe system (all pigsassins are players)
* Very epic helpers?!
